# Movie List

This project is to create a movie list with a drop down menu of genres. The app will render "All Genres" at the initial state. Once a genre is selected from a drop down menu, the movie card will display the selected genre. 

When the cursor is hovered over the card, it will changes color. 

Clicking on the individual movie card will pop-up an alert message informing which movie was selected.

The app doesn't do much. The goal was to practice on creating a React component and managing state. 

## input-process-output model:
